            <h2>Assignment and client</h2>
            <p>During my graduation project I was able to carry out an assignment for Humanitas in collaboration with Internetdiensten Nederland. Humanitas wanted to renew its website, as it has not changed since 2016. Since this time, the Humanitas website has collected a lot of information. The current website is therefore more informative, while Humanitas is more looking for a website that meets the needs of their users and makes the goals of Humanitas clear for new users. From this idea I was able to make a redesign for the Humanitas website.</p>

            <h2>Approach and process</h2>
            <p>During a meeting with Humanitas and contact person Leyla Fortunati-Koubia, the problem and the goal emerged. "The current Humanitas website no longer corresponds to how Humanitas wishes to reach its target groups. Visitors are not sufficiently encouraged on the website to register with the Humanitas association. This is a missed opportunity for Humanitas to attract more participants, volunteers, donors and members. By creating a new user experience web design, more people from the desired target groups are encouraged to participate, volunteer, donate and/or become a member."
              <br/><br/>
            As a result of this problem and goal from a debriefing, I started to do research. Through surveys and interviews I was able to create personas of the participant, the volunteer, the donor and the member. With this, customer journeys were made of the journey of the potential users on the current Humanitas website. This has shown that the process of signing up contains complications and many new/potential users drop out. The experience of the current website did not seem human or trusting to the potential user, when Humanitas is all about helping people.
            <br /><br />
            From this information I was able to design three concepts that led to a beautiful design. This design was created based on system requirements that were made that provide an easy process to sign up as a participant, volunteer, donor and/or member.</p>

          <div id="sectie3">
            <h2>Final result</h2>
            <p>The final design is visualized in a prototype after making design sketches, a navigation structure and a style guide. This clickable prototype, made with Adobe XD, has been tested with the potential target groups through a User Experience Test and with experts through an Expert Review.
            <br /><br />
            The design has also a better experience by using more images of the target groups. By placing a silent video on the homepage, empathy is generated and the user gets a human and trusting feeling. To emphasize the humanity and trustworthy aspect even more, the experience stories with a photo are divided over the different pages of the website.
            <br /><br />
            The completed redesign of the Humanitas website has shown through various tests with the potential target groups (participants, volunteers, donors and members) that people are encouraged to register.</p>
