            <h2>Assignment and client</h2>
            <p>Together with a team we were looking for a new assignment. This is how we ended up with Ronald Ruigrok. Ronald Ruigrok was the founder of 'Online Agency'. Online Agency is specialized in building, managing and optimizing websites and applications. We were asked to design an App doing the groceries.
            <br /><br />
            The boodschap app, or BoodschApp, is intended for parents and their children to get a better grocery shopping experience. This problem emerged from the client; "The problem is that parents and their children generally have an unpleasant experience when grocery shopping. Children experience shopping as unpleasant and can express this in tantrums or other unmanageable behavior. Parents suffer from this. The grocery shopping itself costs them unnecessary time and have to divide their attention between their children and doing the shopping."</p>

            <h2>Approach and process</h2>
            <p>The problem was discussed extensively during a conversation with Ronald Ruigrok. The goal arose from this problem:
              <br /><br />
            "Creating an app, a combination of a similar Pokémon Go application and a grocery shopping list application like the Albert Heijn App, which will eventually be called boodschap App. The purpose of this application is to involve children in shopping. The grocery shopping App ensures that children are motivated to help with grocery shopping. The App also ensures that parents can take their children to the supermarket without worry, children experience grocery shopping as more pleasant and parents can lose their children less quickly in the supermarket."
              <br /><br />
            In order to realize this app, thorough research has been done into the target groups, parents and children, elaborated in personas. User needs have been created for good guidelines for the app. In a competitor analysis, research has been done into the various shopping list apps and children's apps. We also looked at various sensors that can be used while using the app.
            <br /><br />
            From this research, three concepts have been created through scenarios. A final concept was made via a conceptmatrix and feedback from the client. After making system requirements, navigation schemes, flow charts and a styletile, a lo-fi design was made.
            <br /><br />
            In realizing the hi-fi prototype, for parents we thought about an explanation about the app and a lock for children. The app not only shows the shopping list with prices, but also the map of a specific grocery store. With the account for children, thought has been given to being able to create an avatar. Furthermore, the app teaches children about cooking and games are offered.
            <br /><br />
            When arriving at the grocery store, the parent is logged in to the app, children can help with shopping via a tablet via a 'Pokémon Go' system. The parent sees which articles are searched for and found by the child. In this way, no extra groceries can be smuggled.</p>
