            <h2>Assignment and client</h2>
            <p>Through telecom company Ben I was allowed to work on a design for the Ben extend process. Ben's extend process should become clearer and, above all, inviting. The design must match Ben; personal, simple and cost effective.
              <br /><br />
            During this assignment I worked with a full team of UX/UI designers and developers on an amazing end result. The choices within this process were made in consultation with Ben, in order to create the most accurate design possible.</p>

            <h2>Approach and process</h2>
            <p>In a team meeting with Ben we came up with the following problem and goal.
              <br /><br />
            "Ben's current extend process is experienced as difficult by many customers. Customers are also not invited to extend their subscription. Through a User Experience design, customers are motivated to extend their Ben subscription."
            <br /><br />
            First of, the client Ben was investigated. For example, an organizational analysis was done on the origin, the brand values, the motto, the campaigns, the style and communication. Subsequently, the target group was also looked at by means of personas and at the competitors by means of desk research. During the research phase, field research was also carried out by a usability test and interviews with the target groups.
            <br /><br />
            After a thorough investigation into Ben and her target groups, an experience map was used to give an idea of the experience of the extending process. The concepts were made through a co-creation session. With concept mapping and a new brainstorming session, two strong concepts have been made into one. In this concept development, the focus is on the user experience. With a pineapple as a mascot and Artificial Intelligence, the target group is guided and motivated during the extend process.
            <br /><br />
            A prototype was made by making scenarios in a user experience test with Ben and the target group. This prototype was converted into a coded end result with all the processed feedback.</p>

            <h2>End result</h2>
            <p>Ben sets the brand values personal, easy and cost-conscious first. Ben focuses on new clients and on two year subscribed clients. These clients are affected through emails on their experience. Clients get informed about extending their subscribtion with the pineapple mascot. From this point the client ends up on the website. The Ben macot guides the client through the proces. With the help of Artifical intelligence the client gets the best advice they can get. By saving their preferences and usage the website gives the client a couple of choices to change in their extended subscription. When the proces of extending the subscription, the client can celebrate with the Ben mascot. It will be a party with confetti through the screen. </p>
