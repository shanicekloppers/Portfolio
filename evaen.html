            <h2>Assignment and client</h2>
            <p>While participating in the CMDate of the Hague University of Applied Sciences, I met owner Tijmen and visual designer Pepijn. My eye was set on the assignment; Evalytics. <a href="https://evalytics.nl/">Evalytics</a> is a company that deals with courses-, teacher- and test evaluations. They work together with Hogeschool Leiden, Utrecht, Amsterdam and Nijmegen. Evalytics offers its evaluation process via website and application.
              <br /><br />
            After a meeting at the office, I was hired as an intern. During this internship I was able to design the application for students who can carry out their evaluations with Evalytics.</p>

            <h2>Approach and process</h2>
            <p>The assignment of my internship at Evalytics is: “Design an app/website for students where they can use Evalytics.” The problem with this is that students currently do an evaluation via the app, but do not receive any feedback. Currently, communication about the feedback of evaluations is done by email. The intention is that this feedback can be viewed quickly and easily within the Evalytics app. ‘Students want to be heard’.
            <br /><br />
            After discussing the goal and the target group, I looked at the organization Evalytics. In this, all existing information is used to start with the first step; sketching. After making sketches, a lo-fi design was made via Balsamiq with implemented feedback. Based on these designs and positive feedback, a first hi-fi prototype was designed.
            <br /><br />
            To make a pleasant experience, three concepts have been created for the User Experience. One concept was chosen from this, which is choosing the avatar. This is about the silhouette incorporated in the logo of Evalytics. This is most in line with the Evalytics style and the ethnicity of the students. This provides motivation to use the application and to enter evaluations in an easy way.
            <br /><br />
            This concept has of course been implemented in a new hi-fi prototype. By testing the prototype with the target group and experts via Maze, the assignment was completed.</p>

            <h2>End Result</h2>
            <p>At the end of this internship I was able to build two final prototypes; an app and a website for students. These are visualized in a clickable prototype via Sketch and Marvel, tested with Maze.</p>
