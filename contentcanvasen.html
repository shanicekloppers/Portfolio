            <h2>Assignment and client</h2>
            <p>In 2017 Kristel Witvliet and Rico den Boer founded Buzzzle. Buzzzle is a company that works on online communication for (government)organisations to help them create and plan content for specific audiences with a contentstrategy. From this point the wonderful idea came to mind to design a tool for planning content. I got to be involved to create this idea. 
            <br /><br />
            In a nice cafe in Dordrecht I was able to meet Kristel and Rico. After introducing ourselves to each other, we talked about the assignment.</p>

            <h2>Approach and process</h2>
            <p>After meeting with Kristel and Rico, a problem and goal was formed.
              <br /><br />
            "The problem is that organizations currently don't have a clear way to track and schedule content. As a result, organizations cannot work in a structured way on content that contributes to the organization. Buzzzle wants to create an online tool that helps organizations to plan meaningful and relevant content through John Verhoeven's Content Strategy. By means of analysis, Buzzzle wants to use the tool to provide insight into the extent to which the planned content ensures the correct communication with the target groups."
              <br /><br />
            Based on this assignment, I first researched John Verhoeven's content strategy by the book and a meeting. After researching the competitors and the target group, I held a concept brainstorming session with Kristel and Rico. Three concepts have resulted in one concept that has further been developed into a lo-fi prototype.
            <br /><br />
            To visualize the hi-fi prototype, a logo design, style tile and sitemap were made. In collaboration with Buzzzle, Kristel and Rico, the final clickable prototype has been realized.</p>

            <h2>End result</h2>
            <p>A great collaboration with Buzzzle has resulted in an online tool/website that uses John Verhoeven's content strategy. Content is planned by going through a well thought-out step-by-step plan. The results of this content are analyzed, which gives the relevant user(s) insight into the effectiveness of the created content. In this way, the user/organization can better achieve its goal with different target groups.</p>
