            <h2>Assignment and client</h2>
            <p>Through a team project I was able to contribute to a campaign idea for the KWF. KWF is a Koningin Wilhelmina Fund for the fight against cancer in the Netherlands. They are not only committed to fighting cancer, but are also involved in creating a better life for people with cancer and their loved ones.
              <br /><br />
            The assignment from KWF was introduced to increase the volunteers for the region of The Hague by 10% by means of a campaign. In addition to recruiting volunteers, the KWF wants to make the target group, residents of The Hague aged 25 to 65, aware of the KWF and give the organization more name recognition.</p>

            <h2>Approach and process</h2>
            <p>It started with a meeting where KWF explained its shortage of volunteers in the The Hague region. Not only for the collection week in September, but also for other activities that the organization organizes. That is why it is important to set up a campaign to encourage people to sign up as volunteers.
              <br /><br />
            First thing was doing research about KWF and its goals as a fund. Subsequently, the target group was carefully looked at; residents of the The Hague region aged 25 to 65. This research not only formed the execution for the campaign, but it also emerged that there is a lot of ethnicity involved. A brainstorming session was then held with the team, which formed concepts for the campaign.
            <br /><br />
            The 'putting someone else in the spotlight' campaign was formed from this brainstorming session. This was then visualized in various forms and consideration was given to which resources would be used for the campaign. For example, digital campaigning is done through Instagram, Facebook and a landing page. In addition, flyers, posters, bus shelters are used because of the large age differences and cultures within the target group.
            <br /><br />
            This campaign is visualised with Illustrator and Photoshop and presented to KWF. </p>

          <div id="sectie3">
            <h2>End result</h2>
            <p>The concept for the campaign 'A day as a volunteer' shows what it is like to be a volunteer for KWF. What comes forward is how everyone can help by 'putting someone else in the sportlight'. 
              <br /><br />
            Volunteers from The Hague with different ethnicities and ages can tell their story on a poster, flyers, social media and a webpage. These stories get to be spread in different languages. This way more people get to be spoken to in a multicultural city. 
            <br /><br />
            This also gives people notice about KWF and their goals. KWF can make clear volunteering is not only about collecting donations, but also about the pleasure that comes with volunteerwork.</p>
