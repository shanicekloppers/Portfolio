            <h2>Assignment and client</h2>
            <p>Through the campaign 'A day as a volunteer' with the slogan: “Will you put someone else in the spotlight, just like [name]?”, KWF wants to increase the volunteers for 10% in the region The Hague. Next to increasing volunteers, KWF wants to make their audience, inhabitants from The Hague from 25 years of age to 65 years of age, aware of KWF and their organisation.</p>

            <h2>The problem and the goal</h2>
            <p>KWF has a shortage of volunteers in the region The Hague. Not only for the collecting week, but also for other activities. That's why it is important to set up a campaign to bring people to become a volunteer.
              <br /><br />
            KWF The Hague is trying to make volunteerwork fun and interesting. For example listen to what the volunteers have to say. They want to implement their ideas. This way people get a positive look on being a volunteer. Arjan van de Berg is a hardworking chairman and it would be nice if the team got to get bigger, for example community with volunteers. The extended goal is to increase the numbers of volunteers for the region The Hague.</p>

            <h2>End result</h2>
            <p>The concept for the campaign 'A day as a volunteer' shows what it is like to be a volunteer for KWF. What comes forward is how everyone can help by 'putting someone else in the sportlight'. Volunteers from The Hague with different ethnicities and ages can tell their story on a poster, flyers, social media and a webpage. These stories get to be spread in different languages. This way more people get to be spoken to in a multicultural city. This also gives people notice about KWF and their goals. KWF can make clear volunteering is not only about collecting donations, but also about the pleasure that comes with volunteerwork.</p>
